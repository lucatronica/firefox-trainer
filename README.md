## Web game for practicing sweet spotting Melee Fox and Falco's Up-B

Sweetspotting Fox and Falco's Up-B on the ledge requires the ability to input precise angles on the control stick, based solely off visual stimuli. This web game aims to help simplify the process of practicing this skill.

The game requires the use of a gamepad, which can be a gamecube controller if it is setup as a generic gamepad. Only **Chrome, Firefox and Opera** are able to use gamepads at the moment.

## Planned features:

* Score counter, show hardest and easiest angles.
* Control time given to input angles.
* Practice on both sides of stage, and choose which sides to practice.
* Disable cardinal challenge angles.
