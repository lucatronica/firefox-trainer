# Angle Input Practicing Tool (SSBM Firefox Trainer)
## Web game for practicing sweet spotting Melee Fox and Falco's Up-B

Sweetspotting Fox and Falco's Up-B on the ledge requires the input of precise angles on the control stick, based solely off visual stimuli. This web game aims to help practice this skill in an efficient manner.

The game requires the use of a gamepad, which can be a gamecube controller if it is setup as a generic USB gamepad. Only **Chrome, Firefox, Opera and Edge** support gamepads at the moment. If you are using a 4-port gamecube adaptor (with VJoy drivers) you may encounter issues, alternative methods may be more effective.

## Planned additions:

* ~~Success statistics, perhaps showing hardest and easiest angles.~~
* ~~Set time limits given to input challenge angles.~~
* ~~Practice on both sides of stage, and choose which sides to practice.~~
* ~~Choose whether to disable cardinal challenge angles.~~
* Optional dark layout that's easy on the eyes.
* ~~General UI improvements + prettying up.~~
* ~~Get sweetspot tests to accurately match ingame behaviour (currently just a rough guess).~~
* Make multi-port gamecube adaptors work.
* ~~Give option to make Fox grab the ledge on success (better feedback and more rewarding)~~
