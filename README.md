## Web game for practicing sweet spotting Melee Fox and Falco's Up-B

Sweetspotting Fox and Falco's Up-B on the ledge requires the input of precise angles on the control stick, based solely off visual stimuli. This web game aims to help practice this skill in a realistic manner. However the game is likely unrepresentative of Melee's actual behaviour in small ways, so shouldn't be the only way you practice this skill.

The game requires the use of a gamepad, which can be a gamecube controller if it is setup as a generic USB gamepad. Only **Chrome, Firefox and Opera** are able to use gamepads at the moment.

## Planned additions:

* Score counter, show hardest and easiest angles.
* Set time limits given to input challenge angles.
* Practice on both sides of stage, and choose which sides to practice.
* Disable cardinal challenge angles.
* Optional dark layout that's easy on the eyes.
* General UI improvements + prettying up.
* Get sweetspot tests to accurately match ingame behaviour (currently just a rough guess).

I'm very innexperienced with javascript and git, so please feel free to fix or improve on the project!
