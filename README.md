## Web game for practicing sweet spotting Melee Fox and Falco's Up-B

Sweetspotting Fox and Falco's Up-B on the ledge requires the ability to input precise angles on the control stick, based solely off visual stimuli. This web game aims to help practice this skill in a realistic manner.

The game requires the use of a gamepad, which can be a gamecube controller if it is setup as a generic USB gamepad. Only **Chrome, Firefox and Opera** are able to use gamepads at the moment.

## Planned features:

* Score counter, show hardest and easiest angles.
* Set time limits given to input angles.
* Practice on both sides of stage, and choose which sides to practice.
* Disable cardinal challenge angles.
* Optional dark layout that's easy on the eyes.
